Tutorial repository (AKA my first repository)
Hi my name psuedonym is DMandy. The D stands for developer and Mandy is the name of my Laptop from which I work. Im a new developer and I hope to work on myself continously and grow as time passes. I am Nigerian, and before you raise any of your eyebrows at your screen I want you to know that Good, honest, caring and genuinely humane people (like myself) exist in Nigeria :) and we outnumber the bad people by a very wide margin (*just putting it out there*). Its just bad press.
